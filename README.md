# Ember HAL Template

This is a simple web client template for setting up an Ember application
that communicates with a compatible HAL/JSON web service, for example
[ruby-webmachine-roar-template](https://github.com/kgish/ruby-webmachine-roar-template).

## Instructions

In order to install and start this application, run the following commands.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/kgish/ember-hal-template hal-client
$ cd hal-client
$ bundle install
```

Configure the RESTAdapter by editing the file `js/app.js` and modifying the `host` like this:

```javascript
// js/app.js
DS.RESTAdapter.reopen({
    host: 'http://0.0.0.0:8080' // <= change ip and port
});
```

Start the client by running the following command.

```bash
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 ...
```

After which you can fire up you favorite browser and point it
to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

## HAL Adapter

In order to get this application running properly with the ember default
`RESTAdapter`, I had to do some serious tweaking.

The server will return HAL/JSON payload which looks something like this:

```javascript
{products: [{product: {attributes}},{...}]
```

which before being passed through to the `RESTAdapter` needs to be converted
into this:

```javascript
{products: [{attributes},{...}]
```

This is achieved by extending the default `ProductSerializer` and redefining
the `normalizePayload` hook like this:

```javascript
App.ProductSerializer = DS.RESTSerializer.extend({
    normalizePayload: function(payload) {
        if (payload.products) {
            var normalizedPayload = { products: [] };
            payload.products.forEach(function(item){
                normalizedPayload.products.pushObject(item.product);
            });
            payload = normalizedPayload;
        }
        return payload;
    }
    ...
});
```

## Thanks

I had a look at the [Ember Data HAL Adapter](https://github.com/locks/ember-data-hal-adapter)
written by [Ricardo Mendes](https://github.com/locks), but unfortunately could
not get it to work.

However, reading through the code was very enlightening and gave me the
opportunity to pull out some valuable code snippets, thanks.
