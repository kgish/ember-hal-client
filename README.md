# Ember HAL Client

An example ember application that communicates with a compatible HAL/JSON web service.

For example, have a look at [ruby-hal-server](https://github.com/kgish/ruby-hal-server) 
which I created in tandem to this project for use as a test harnass.

Built using the [ember-cli](http://www.ember-cli.com/) framework.

## Prerequisites

You will need the following things properly installed on your computer.

* [Git](http://git-scm.com/)
* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) (with NPM)
* [Bower](http://bower.io/)
* [Ember CLI](http://www.ember-cli.com/)
* [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/)

## Installation

In order to install and start this application, run the following commands.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/kgish/ember-hal-template hal-client
$ cd hal-client
$ npm install
$ bower install
```

## Configuration

Although the defaults work out of the box, you might have to configure certain
parameters in order to get the application to work properly.

This is accomplished by editing the file `config/environment.js` and making
the following changes.

### RESTAdapter host

```javascript
module.exports = function(environment) {
  var ENV = {
    ...
    },

    APP: {
      RESTADAPTER_HOST: 'http://0.0.0.0:8080'
    }
  };
  ...

  return ENV;
};
```

## Running / Development

Start the client by running the following command.

```bash
$ ember server
version: 0.1.6
Livereload server on port 35729
Serving on http://0.0.0.0:4200/
```

After which you can fire up you favorite browser and point it
to [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200).

### Running Tests

* `ember test`
* `ember test --server`
* `http://localhost:4200/tests`

### Building

* `ember build` (development)
* `ember build --environment production` (production)

## HAL Serializer (kind of)

In order to get this application running properly with the ember default
`RESTAdapter`, I had to do some serious tweaking.

The server will return HAL/JSON payload which looks needs to be
reformatted before passing on to the client.

For a `single` resource, the incoming payload from the API Server looks
likes this:

```javascript
payload = {
    _links: {
        self: {
            href: '/products/5'
        },
        curies: [
            {
                name:      'ht',
                href:      'http://0.0.0.0:8080:/rels/{rel}',
                templated: true
            }
        ]
    },
    name:     'horse',
    category: 'animal',
    price:    3021
}
```

Which needs to be converted to this:

```javascript
payload = {
    product: {
        id:       5,
        name:     'horse',
        category: 'animal',
        price:    3021
    }
}
```

For a `collection` of resources, the incoming payload from the API Server
will look like this:

```javascript
payload = {
    _links: {
        self: {
            href: '/products'
        },
        curies: [
            {
                name:      'ht',
                href:      'http://localhost:8080:/rels/{rel}',
                templated: true
            }
        ],
        ht:product: [
            {
                'href':     '/products/1',
                'name':     'dragon',
                'category': 'health',
                'price':    2241
            },
            ...
        ]
    }
}
```

Which needs to be converted to this:

```javascript
payload = {
    products: [
        {
            id:         5,
            name:     'horse',
            category: 'animal',
            price:    3021
        },
        ...
    ]
}
```

This is achieved by extending the default `ProductSerializer` and redefining
the `normalizePayload` hook like this:

```javascript
App.ProductSerializer = DS.RESTSerializer.extend({
    ...
    normalizePayload: function(payload) {
        var normalizedPayload = {};
        if (payload['_links']) {
            var links = payload['_links'],
                href = links['self']['href'];
            if (href === '/products') {
                normalizedPayload = this._normalizeCollection(payload)
            } else {
                normalizedPayload = this._normalizeResource(payload)
            }
        }
        return normalizedPayload;
    },

    /* private */

    _normalizeResource: function(payload) {
        var links = payload['_links'],
            href = links['self']['href'],
            id = href.replace(/^\/[^\/]+\//, ''),
            normalizedPayload = {
            product: {
                id:       id,
                name:     payload['name'],
                category: payload['category'],
                price:    payload['price']
            }
        };
        return normalizedPayload;
    },

    _normalizeCollection: function(payload) {
        var links = payload['_links'],
            href = links['self']['href'],
            products = links['ht:product'];
        var list = [];
        products.forEach(function(product){
            var id = product.href.replace(/^\/[^\/]+\//, '');
            list.push({
                id:       id,
                name:     product['name'],
                category: product['category'],
                price:    product['price']
            });
        });
        return { products: list };
    }
});
```

The same will need to be done with the `user` resource, or in the future any
newer resources that must be accessed by the client.

## HAL Serializer (Pro)

Of course, this is not very efficient having to copy code for each resource,
so a better more generic handling should be done centrally at the level of
the `ApplicationSerializer`. 

In order to achieve this, we generate an ember-cli blueprint:
```bash
$ ember-cli generate serializer application
```
Which creates the file `app/serializers/application.js` and after proper
modification should look something like this:

```javascript
import DS from 'ember-data';

export default DS.RESTSerializer.extend({
    ...
    normalizePayload: function(payload) {
        var normalizedPayload = {};
        if (payload['_links']) {
            var links = payload['_links'],
                href = links['self']['href'],
                m = href.match(/^\/([^\/]+)s(\/(.*))?$/); // See below.
            var idn = m[3] || 'none';
            if (m[3]) {
                normalizedPayload = this._normalizeResource(payload, m[1], m[3])
            } else {
                normalizedPayload = this._normalizeCollection(payload, m[1], 'ht')
            }
        }
        return normalizedPayload;
    },

    /* private */

    _normalizeResource: function(payload, resource, id) {
        var normalizedPayload = {};
        normalizedPayload[resource]['id'] = id;
        for (var key in payload) {
            if (key === '_links') continue;
            normalizedPayload[resource][key] = payload[key];
        }
        return normalizedPayload;
    },

    _normalizeCollection: function(payload, resource, name) {
        var normalizedPayload = {};
        var links = payload['_links'],
            resources = links[name+':'+resource];
        var list = [];
        resources.forEach(function(resource) {
            var id = resource.href.replace(/^\/[^\/]+\//, ''); // See below.
            var next = {};
            next['id'] = id;
            for (var key in resource) {
                if (key === 'href') continue;
                next[key] = resource[key];
            }
            list.push(next);
        });
        normalizedPayload[resource+'s'] = list;
        return normalizedPayload;
    }
});
```

You are probably scratching your head trying to get to grips with those two
mangled-looking regular expressions I used, so I will try and explain them.

```javascript
m = href.match(/^\/([^\/]+)s(\/(.*))?$/);
```

The value of href is either '/{name}s' or '/{name}s/id'

* If href = `/products` then `m[1,2,3] = 'product', undefined, undefined`
* If href = `/products/22` then `m[1,2,3] = 'product', '/22', '22'`

Therefore if `m[3]` is undefined then payload is a `collection` otherwise
it's a plain-vanilla `resource` with `id = m[3]`.

For this demo application, resource = `product` or `user` but this generic
serializer should handle any other resource from the HAL/JSON.

```javascript
id = resource.href.replace(/^\/[^\/]+\//, '');
```

Given a string like `/products/23` strip off the beginning and return the
terminating string after the last backlash resulting in `23`.

## Authentication and how it works 

All of activities related to authentication are handled in the sessions 
controller defined in the `app/controllers/sessions.js` file.

Two cookies are used for persistent session handling, namely:

* `access_token` (token)
* `auth_user` (currentUser)

Logging into the server is done by sending a `POST /sessions` with the
following payload included in the request body:

```javascript
{ password: 'pindakaas', username_or_email: 'kiffin' }
```

Assuming success the server responds with a `201 Created` passing back the
`access_token` as part of the following payload in the response body:

```javascript
{ api_key: { user_id: 1, access_token: '26c06...342aa' } }
```

Failure to login results is a `401 Unauthorized` which means that either or
both of the username and password were incorrect.

The `access_token` is stored for safe-keeping in the appropriate cookie:

```javascript
Ember.$.cookie('access_token', access_token, { root: '/'});
```
 
and thereafter needs to be included in the authorization header of all 
following requests in order to gain access:

```javascript
Ember.$.ajaxSetup({
    contentType: 'application/json; charset=utf-8',
    headers: {
       'Authorization': 'Bearer '+access_token
    }
});
```

At his point the attributes related to the current user can be acquired by
sending a `GET /users/user_id` (together with the token authorization, of course).

The server send backs the the user data in HAL/JSON format in the response body which
after being converted by the serializer (above) looks like this:

```javascript
currentUser = {
    id:         1,
    name:       'Kiffin Gish',
    username:   'kiffin',
    email:      'kiffin.gish@planet.nl',
    is_admin:   true,
    login_date: '2015-01-23T20:12:24.000Z'
}
```

This is also saved in a cookie for safe-keeping:

```javascript
Ember.$.cookie('auth_user', currentUser, { root: '/'});
```

During page refresh or incoming url the cookies are first checked to see if
an authenticated user is available, and if so use those cookies for further
validation purposes.

After this you're in the ballpark and can proceed freely to your seat behind
home plate.

## Todo list

There are still a number of minor issues which should be looked into, namely
the following:

* Value of 'ht' is hardcoded, instead use autodiscovery on root resource.
* Need to implement better error handling.
* Message/error banner for generic handling of user info.
* Migrate to `ember-cli-simple-auth` (maybe).
* The global flags `isAuthenticated`, `isAdmin` and `currentUser` are not DRY, need to be handled more elegantly.
* Pagination for the products list (nice to have).
* Successful user registration should redircet to login page with username field prefilled.

## Thanks

I had a look at the [Ember Data HAL Adapter](https://github.com/locks/ember-data-hal-adapter)
written by [Ricardo Mendes](https://github.com/locks), but unfortunately could
not get it to work.

However, reading through the code was very enlightening and gave me the
opportunity to pull out some valuable code snippets, thanks.
